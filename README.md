# *Basic Calamity Boss Guide*

_**Version: 1.3.4.103**_

Bosses are listed in old progression order, we're not taking non-linearity into account.

Also check out [wiki guide](https://calamitymod.gamepedia.com/Guide:Class_setups).

**Subjectively all-around best weapons are marked with cursive.**

*Anything with a + on it means "or subsequent upgrades"*

*Ex: Hermes Boots+ means you could also use things like spectre boots, etc.*

*Something that says (optional) means "this is dependent on preference" over “this is recommended”*

*Mostly worked on by drh and whoever's left alive in the team.*
*If you got any improvements then send them over to drh#1109.*

Or plop them over to [discord](https://discord.gg/8hwAmgb).

## Tips and class viability

### General

* How to use accessory lists: first you grab a mobility accessory (wings/boots), then you grab your class accessories, fill the rest with overall good items (like straight damage increases).
* Halibut Cannon isn't accounted for everything, because once you get it - your run is over, might as well just stop trying.
* Yes, you are supposed to use buffs on every boss. Too hard to farm? Blood Orbs. Too lazy to do it? Don't complain about things being hard, I guess.
* Rage and Adrenaline only take base damage into calculations, so Lucky is the preferred modifier if you plan on using them often.
* Half of the bosses, at the very least, are vulnerable to circling. Other half is vulnerable to running away from them.
* When farming money off bosses, turn defiled on for extra profit when opening bags.
* You can still get treasure bags through Armageddon, but I don't know why you'd do that.

### Pre-HM

* **All classes**

    * If you get an early Blood Moon and gather enough blood orbs you can get abyss weapons way before you're supposed to - make a Zen potion on Alchemy Table up on the main planetoids, venture into the dungeon (Zen should block Dungeon Guardians) and hope for some golden keys in wooden chests so that you can keep praying for shadow key.
    * Boots are mandatory for 90% of the fights.
    * Warding isn't too bad at this stage, although more damage would be preferred.
    * If in Revengeance or above consider farming King Slime/Desert Scourge for Laudanum/Stress Pills (Laud's much better), gives too many stats packed into one accessory.
    * Goblins are pre-boss, so go ahead and knock yourself out with all those upgraded accessories.
    * Abyss weapons are kings of pre-HM, get them as soon as you kill Skele.
    * Money farms: Crabulon and Queen Bee.

* **Ranged**

    * Worm bosses die to piercing damage real fast (Jester arrows).
    * After EoC you can get Pumpler, which is generally better than Minishark.
    * Conversely, if you want to use Minishark consider using Shark Tooth Necklace, it will increase your damage up quite nicely.

* **Melee**

    * Invest in Seashell Boomerang early, it could easily be your main damage source for the entire stage.
    * Bladecrest Oathsword is also an ok option for "ranged" combat.
    * Claws are iffy to use now, so don't bother (unless it’s Mycelial Claws).

* **Mage**

    * You can easily get an early combo of Wizard Hat, Diamond Robe and Meteor/Jungle Pants and keep it until Titanium/Daedalus armor. Titanium obviously is better.

* **Summoner**

    * AI tends to be extremely stupid, so don't neglect cancelling the buff and resummoning them on enemy’s face.
    * Hive Mind/Perfs summons are somewhat bad due to the fact that they pierce.
    * Hornets and Imps can also go :gun: themselves.

* **Thrower**

    * Grenades are an extremely cheap source of major damage.
    * The sooner you get Raider's Talisman - the better, it’s practically a class emblem that compensates for the fact that you don’t get one on WoF.

### HM

* **All classes**

    * If you're not using wings - you’re doing something wrong.
    * Leaf Wings are the first ones you can get, and you should do that. Or don't, Soul of Cryogen exists.
    * Blood Pact is bad. Yes, that fucking bad. Don't ever use it.
    * So is Heart of the Elements.
    * Hallowed armor is also bad.
    * Right after Clonelamitas dies most classes can skidaddle to the Abyss and get better weapons. Except melee. Typhon's Greed is a meme.
    * Everyone can ignore GSS, the only "good" weapon is Duststorm in a Bottle, and it's pretty much outclassed by any throwing weapon you can get at that point.
    * Money farms: Queen Bee and Ravager (only if you're used to him, he’s quite a pain to nohit, even with post-ML gear otherwise it’s better to armageddon Queens).
    * If you stock up 30-40 Ravager bags for post-Providence you can get 3000 platinum just for opening them.
    * If you have free accessory slots you can always toss in an emblem.
    * Universal support weapons: Golden Shower and it's upgrade - Everglade Spray.

* **Ranged**

    * If you want to have a much easier time with half the bosses - use Daedalus Stormbow. It's not on any boss because it’s stupid and works until Golem.
    * Verium Bullets are the first bullets that are going to home, feel free to make a bunch of them.
    * Terra Bullets are also really good,
* **Melee**

    * **OATHBLADE** (it's a post-mech weapon that kills Plantera in 24 seconds)
    * Terra Blade is the offensive option, Terra Edge is the defensive, pick whatever suits you most.
    * If going for true melee you should stack Violent reforges and grab armors that increase your melee speed (Old One's Army works).

* **Mage**

    * Until you get Ataxia vanilla armors are going to be better than Calamity's, so don’t get too trigger-happy with your upgrades.

* **Summoner**

    * You'll be stuck with Claspers until Optic Staff, which promptly will be upgraded (read: replaced) into Entropy’s Vigil.
    * "Stupid AI" tip still works, but at this point you might have a lot of slots, so that would overpower the dumbassery of the most neglected class (after the sexually confused melee-ranged hybrid).

* **Thrower**

    * Throwing sucks.
    * No, seriously, your options are going to be HM ore consumables before Cryogen, Ice Stars after Cryogen, Brimblade if you go according to this progression, Ballistic Poison Bomb after Clone, Bracklish Flask after Levi. That's about as much upgrades as you can get.

### Post-ML

* **All classes**

    * ![Yes.](/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_0.png)
    * At this point having Warding prefix on anything is equivalent to giving yourself -4% damage/crit chance.
    * Remember the HotE and Blood Pact tip from above? Draedon's Heart joins them.
    * After Polter everyone except ranged and melee should go into the abyss and farm their respective weapons.
    * Before you kill Provi go back to Ravager and farm him for some bags (open them after Provi), that would net you a shitton of bloodstone without you having to suffer through the fattest HM boss.
    * Money farms: Profaned Guardians, Ravager, DoG.
    * Keep Everglade Spray, it's hard to overestimate 20 seconds of Ichor.

* **Ranged**

    * Clockwork Bow is an early "stupid" choice, because it has immense damage output, but doesn't often hit things. It’s the equivalent of random(360). On Providence it should do quite nicely however.
    * Terra Bullets are now bad, don't use them, grab Holy Fire.
    * Post-DoG guns are shit, use bows.

* **Melee**

    * Stick to Ataxia until DoG dies.
    * Once Polter ceases to exist - grab Banshee Hook, this is gonna be your best weapon for some time.

* **Mage**

    * Don't forget to eat all the mana upgrades.

* **Summoner**

    * Don't go for Eldritch artifact unless you’re planning on multiclassing with mage.
    * However please do go for Godly, 8 extra minion slots is nothing to laugh about.

* **Thrower**

    * Honestly, there isn't that much to say about throwing, you’re gonna go from Pitchforks to Amputator to Valediction to Executioner’s Blade to Celestus or Scourge of the Cosmos.

*"Disgusting overbuffed abomination."* 

![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_60.png)

* **Armor Sets:**

    * **Any class: **Lunar

    * **Melee: **Ataxia.

    * **Throwing: **Xeroc.

* **Weapon Loadouts:**

    * **Ranger: ***Onyx Chain Blaster*, Astreal Defeat, Shredder. Holy Fire/Terra Ammo.

    * **Melee:** Ark of the Elements, Elemental Shiv, *Galactus Blade, Omega Biome Blade.*

    * **Mage: **Nuclear Fury, Arch Amaryllis.

    * **Summoner: **Elemental Axe, Stardust Dragon, Energy Staff.

    * **Throwing: **Elemental Disk.

* **General Accessories:**

    * Seraph Tracers, Asgard's Valor, Absorber, The Community, Deific Amulet.

* **Class Specific Accessories:**

    * **Ranged: **Daedalus Emblem, Ranger Emblem.

    * **Melee: **Bloody Worm Scarf.

    * **Mage: **Sigil of Calamitas, Eldritch Soul Artifact.

    * **Summoner: **Statis' Blessing, Statis’ Curse.

    * **Throwing: **Statis' Ninja Belt.

* **Strategy:**

    * Under no circumstances come close to this really angry slime, because his damage has been buffed to ~6500 per hit (thus rendering any form of defense other than dodging obsolete). Strats generally stay the same from first encounter, but you're not allowed to take even a single hit. Keep your RoD at ready (this also includes your finger on your movement buttons) since he always teleports on top of you and you **don’t** want to be under him when he does it.

## Profaned Guardians

*"Guardians of the unholy flame…"*

![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_61.png)

* **Armor Sets:**

    * **Any class: **Lunar

    * **Melee: **Ataxia.

    * **Throwing: **Xeroc.

* **Weapon Loadouts:**

    * **Ranger: ***Onyx Chain Blaster*, Holy Fire Bullets, Astreal Defeat, Shredder, Elemental Blaster. Terra Ammo.

    * **Melee: ***Galactus Blade*, Ark of the Elements, *Omega Biome Blade*.

    * **Mage: **Elemental Ray, Nuclear Fury, Nano Purge, Ultra Liquidator, Asteroid Staff

    * **Summoner: **Elemental Axe, Energy Staff, Stardust Dragon.

    * **Throwing: **Elemental Disk.

* **General Accessories:**

    * Seraph Tracers, Asgard's Valor, Absorber, The Community, Ambrosial Ampoule, Deific Amulet.

* **Class Specific Accessories:**

    * **Ranged: **Daedalus Emblem, Ranger Emblem.

    * **Melee: **Bloody Worm Scarf.

    * **Mage: **Sigil of Calamitas, Eldritch Soul Artifact.

    * **Summoner: **Statis' Blessing, Statis’ Curse.

    * **Throwing: **Statis' Ninja Belt.

* **Strategy:**

    * Keep your distance, and don't let the main guardian fly over you, since being below it will make it dash down at you. Making a slope out of actuated hallow blocks will also help due to expanding the biome. Or just fight them in Hell, that works too.

## Providence, the Profaned Goddess

*"The air is burning…"*

![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_63.png)

* **Armor Sets:**

    * **Any class: **Lunar

    * **Melee: **Ataxia.

    * **Throwing: **Xeroc.

* **Weapon Loadouts:**

    * **Ranger: ***Onyx Chain Blaster*, Clockwork Bow, Shredder, Elemental Blaster, Starfleet. Holy Fire Ammo.

    * **Melee: ***Omega Biome Blade*, Elemental Shiv, *Galactus Blade*.

    * **Mage: **Elemental Ray, Nano Purge, *Genisis*, Last Prism.

    * **Summoner: **Elemental Axe, Energy Staff, Stardust Dragon.

    * **Throwing: **Elemental Disk, Xeroc Pitchforks.

* **General Accessories:**

    * Seraph Tracers, Asgard's Valor, The Community, Absorber, Ambrosial Ampoule, Deific Amulet, Void of Calamity+.

* **Class Specific Accessories:**

    * **Ranged: **Daedalus Emblem.

    * **Melee:** Bloody Worm Scarf.

    * **Mage: **Sigil of Calamitas, Eldritch Soul Artifact.

    * **Summoner: **Statis' Blessing, Statis’ Curse.

    * **Throwing: **Statis' Ninja Belt.

* **Strategy:**

    * Try to always run in a single direction. When she enters her shell, circle around her, then keep running when she exits. You also want to mostly fly because lava blobs stick to literally any tile. Use ML strats for laser attack.

    * Taking down the extra guardians should be your main priority.

## Storm Weaver

*"The Devourer took pity on its fellow kind…"*

![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_65.png)

* **Armor Sets: **

    * **Any class: **Tarragon.

    * **Melee: **Ataxia.

* **Weapon Loadouts:**

    * **Ranger: ***Onyx Chain Blaster*, Holy Fire Bullets, Blissful Bombardier, Shredder, Telluric Glare. Holy Fire Ammo.

    * **Melee: **Stellar Striker, Holy Collider, Ark of the Elements, Galactus Blade.

    * **Mage: ***Elemental Ray*, Nuclear Fury, Purge Guzzler.

    * **Summoner: **Elemental Axe, Energy Staff, Stardust Dragon.

    * **Throwing: **Elemental Disk, Molten Amputator.

* **General Accessories:**

    * Seraph Tracers, Asgard's Valor/Elysian Aegis, Bloodflare Core, The Community, Absorber, Ambrosial Ampoule, Void of Calamity+.

* **Class Specific Accessories:**

    * **Ranged: **Daedalus Emblem, Ranger Emblem.

    * **Melee: **Yharim's Insignia, Bloody Worm Scarf.

    * **Mage: **Sigil of Calamitas, Eldritch Soul Artifact.

    * **Summoner: **Statis' Blessing, Statis’ Curse.

    * **Throwing: **Statis' Ninja Belt.

* **Strategy:**

    * On Rev or below, just stay grounded and run away while aiming at its tail. On Death do the same thing for phase 1, but in phase 2 try to loop around the worm whenever it gets close, and then run away while shooting it from a distance. In reality it's a big fat crawltipede.

## Ceaseless Void

* "A deadly rift formed, in which the concept of reality itself faltered…"*

![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_66.png)

* **Armor Sets: **

    * **Any class: **Tarragon.

    * **Melee: **Ataxia.

* **Weapon Loadouts:**

    * **Ranger: **Seadragon, Blissful Bombardier, Telluric Glare. Holy Fire Ammo.

    * **Melee: **Stellar Striker, Holy Collider, Elemental Shiv, The Mutilator, Elemental Lance.

    * **Mage: **Elemental Ray, Nuclear Fury, Purge Guzzler.

    * **Summoner: **Elemental Axe, Energy Staff, Stardust Dragon.

    * **Throwing: **Elemental Disk, Molten Amputator.

* **General Accessories:**

    * Seraph Tracers, Asgard's Valor/Elysian Aegis, Bloodflare Core, The Community, Absorber, Ambrosial Ampoule.

* **Class Specific Accessories:**

    * **Ranged: **Daedalus Emblem.

    * **Melee: **Yharim's Insignia, Bloody Worm Scarf.

    * **Mage: **Sigil of Calamitas, Eldritch Soul Artifact.

    * **Summoner: **Statis' Blessing, Statis’ Curse.

    * **Throwing: **Statis' Ninja Belt.

* **Strategy:**

    * Attacks with lots of AoE or that hit rapidly are amazing for the dark energy. Move in a circular pattern around your arena so the electric orbs the Void itself spawns are separated. On Rev he can create big circles of immune Dark Energies, so invest your time into making a big dungeon arena that you're going to reuse for Polter.

## Signus, Envoy of the Devourer

*"...capable of exterminating virtually anyone, anywhere…"*

![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_67.png)

* **Armor Sets: **

    * **Any class: **Tarragon.

    * **Melee: **Ataxia.

* **Weapon Loadouts:**

    * **Ranger: ***Seadragon*, *Blissful Bombardier, *Telluric Glare. Holy Fire Ammo.

    * **Melee: **Stellar Striker, Holy Collider, Terratomere, Lacerator, Galactus Blade

    * **Mage: ***Mistlestorm*, Nuclear Fury.

    * **Summoner: **Elemental Axe, Energy Staff, Stardust Dragon.

    * **Throwing: **Elemental Disk, Molten Amputator.

* **General Accessories:**

    * Seraph Tracers, Asgard's Valor/Elysian Aegis, Bloodflare Core, The Community, Absorber, Ambrosial Ampoule.

* **Class Specific Accessories:**

    * **Ranged: **Daedalus Emblem.

    * **Melee: **Yharim's Insignia, Bloody Worm Scarf.

    * **Mage: **Sigil of Calamitas, Eldritch Soul Artifact.

    * **Summoner: **Statis' Blessing, Statis’ Curse.

    * **Throwing: **Statis' Ninja Belt.

* **Strategy:**

    * Treat it like a spookier Brimstone Elemental for everything except for the last phase. Once he enters his bitey phase, move in a figure eight pattern to avoid the cosmilamps that spawn. When you pass under him during his biting phase, dash to the side where he's going to come from and keep running in order to avoid him voring you.

## Polterghast

* **Class Specific Accessories:**

    * **Ranged: **Daedalus Emblem.

    * **Melee: **Yharim's Insignia, Bloody Worm Scarf, Yoyo Bag

    * **Mage: **Sigil of Calamitas, Eldritch Soul Artifact.

    * **Summoner: **Statis' Blessing, Statis’ Curse.

    * **Throwing: **Statis' Ninja Belt.

* **Strategy:**

    * Arena is crucial for Polter, having a small or wonky fighting space is going to do nothing but get you killed. Bring every buff potion you can. Circle strat for phase 1 and 2, tight circles. Phase 3 - run away slowly and be careful of the many projectiles plaguing the arena. Kill the ghost version of polter first, since the main version takes basically no damage while it's alive (90% DR in Rev/Death if it’s alive, it’s literally a 30% increase). Sloped blocks could help you with dodging projectiles.

    * The most important and the only thing you have to do this trip is to kill *most* minibosses that lurk at the bottom of the abyss. They all drop new weapons (Maulers are included in that list). Ranged characters kill Maulers in Sulphur Sea, Throwing people kill Reaper Sharks for Valediction, Summoners have Colossal Squids that will drop Calamari's Lament, Melee is stuck with killing Juvenile Eidolon Wyrms (not adults!). If you see an adult wyrm - run, just run, it will probably kill you if you trigger it. Banshee Hook is a pretty good weapon for dealing with the minibosses until you’re able to get some of their weapons. Using Rod of Discord is still forbidden.

    * **Throwing: **

* **Strategies:**

    * Make two skybridges. During his flying phase, either run along the ground while shooting his head or do a loop above him to get a better line of fire on his face. During his grounded phase, drop him down to an area below your main platform and shoot at him from above. On Rev+, prioritize the Thots when they spawn. Phases can be differentiated either by background color, or by debuffs you get (Warped for passive phase, Extreme Gravity for active). When this phase dies, the sentinels will spawn one at a time. The order is Ceaseless Void, Storm Weaver, and then Signus. When Signus dies, phase 2 starts.

*"It's not over yet, kid!"*

![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_76.png)

* **Gear stays the same, but the fight is filled with a new array of deadly attacks.**

* **Strategies:**

* Flying mode stays the same as in phase 1, but ground mode has a completely different AI. When Doggo first drops down, he will try to cut you off, getting in front of you so you have to turn around. Once he drops, he will start charging at you. Early in the fight his charges are rather simple to avoid, but as his health gets lower and he gets faster, he has a much easier time getting to wherever you are. He still has laser walls like in the old update, but they are now only in his "laser wall spam" phases instead of persisting throughout the whole fight. Near the end of the fight, He pretty much constantly shoots his flamethrower, and with him charging you frequently this could be very dangerous.

* During ground phase, drop below your platforms a little bit to get him to fly down below you. He thinks you're dropping down so he tries to drop down with you, but if you fly back up after he starts dropping you’ll get some distance on him.

* Laser wall spam phases are exactly the same, just jump and dash between them. Accessories that increase jump height can make this more complicated.

* When his ground phase gets faster as the fight goes on, do everything you can to get distance on him. Use the dropping below platforms thing, fly up and down between platform layers, etc.

* **Strategy:**

    * Build your arena on surface, going to space/underground enrages him. The better you get at knowing what he does in each phase, the more likely you are to survive. The general movement pattern consists of a large oval, try to put a platform kinda high up in your arena for refreshing your flight time. Try to spawn his infernadoes in opposite corners of the arena, something like top right, then bottom left. Don't be afraid of his true second phase, it’s not there yet. Also move in an oval shape to try and space out the infernadoes.

* **Strategies:**

    * Strats mostly don't change up until his final phase where he will become invulnerable for some time (use RoD for dodging everything he throws at you). Upon transition he will heal up and you just do what you did before - shoot at it until it dies. When below 66% HP Yharon will start spawning flarenadoes again, and when at very low HP he will begin charging at you constantly. On Death this phase goes fucking ballistic so always keep an eye out for projectiles while doing your ovals. And don’t forget about your minimap.

    * **Throwing: **Statis' Ninja Belt, Statis’ Belt of Curses, Nanotech.

* **Special combination: **Mage armor, Statis' Blessing and Statis’ Curse(+3 minion slots each), Dark Sun Ring(+1 slot)/Eldritch Soul Artifact (+2 slots), Voltaic Climax, Cosmic Immaterializer. Having specifically those 3 accessories should bring you to 10 minion slots, allowing you to use Immaterializer while also using Voltaic as your main weapon. This combination has been banned from Untouchable/Dead Inside challenges.

* **Weapon explanations:**

    * **Ranger: 	**

        * Heavenly Gale is pretty much the only ranged weapon at its tier that can do decent damage against SCal.

        * Chicken Cannon is specifically for killing the soul seeker ring as its explosions have massive range.

    * **Melee: 	**

        * Ark of the Cosmos will be your main damage dealer.

        * Scourge of the Cosmos (Melee) helps kill the brimstone hearts and makes the 1st sepulcher phase go by very quickly. It should also always be used when SCal is invulnerable (except for the soul seeker part and the final bullet hell). 

        * Burning Sky is specifically for killing the soul seeker ring. This weapon's projectiles cover a large portion of the screen, and as such it is very good for killing off the soul seeker ring that often goes offscreen.

        * Exoblade can be an alternative heart killer if you don't want to bother with Scourge.

    * **Mage: **

        * Voltaic Climax will be your main damage weapon. Used for pretty much almost everything in the fight.

        * Yharim's crystal has enough dps to be viable but is generally harder to use than Voltaic Climax.

        * Phoenix Flame Barrage, much like Burning Sky and Chicken Cannon, is specifically for the soul seeker ring due to its bigger AoE.

    * **Summoner: **For summoners, the most optimal setups are:

1. 1 Cosmic Immaterializer + 1 Yharon son, with the rest mechworm.

2. 1 Cosmic Immaterializer + 2 Yharon sons, with the rest mechworm.

3. 1 Cosmic Immaterializer + 1 Yharon son + Godly Soul Artifact, with the rest mechworm.

.

    * **Throwing: **

        * Celestus will be your main damage weapon. You'll also have to use this for the soul seeker ring, as sadly throwing don’t have any other options. Try to guess/watch where the soul seekers are, and aim as best as you can.

        * Scourge of the Cosmos (Throwing): like melee, use this one during the first bullet hell, then switch to Celestus when sepulcher spawns. The eaters from this weapon will help kills the brimstone hearts and makes the 1st sepulcher phase go by very quickly.

* **Strategy:**

    * Supreme Calamitas DOES have a set pattern of attacks, she will do the same thing every time. The only variance is that when she says "Don't worry, I still have plenty of tricks left" she will always fly above you while firing attacks before falling back into place in her pattern loop. I will leave a picture for her pattern below this. Try to stay near the ceiling at all times during her bullet hell phases to make the exploding projectiles spawn outside of the arena and break against the arena walls. If you can surround your Scal arena in walls, they can explode farther out and give you bigger gaps to dodge through.![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_82.png)

    * In her mobile phase, where she doesn't stick to your sides and flies around, she will choose her attacks randomly. The safest thing to do here is to try and move to one side of the arena, and back to the other side back and forth in a half circle in shape of a "U". Move decently quickly but carefully; you don’t want to get sniped by any of her projectiles. In her 2nd phase, she charges at you about twice as often as the 1st phase, so always be on your guard, and be prepared to dodge her charges when she turns black.

	First Bullet Hell Phase

    * Use horizontal movement for the first 5 seconds, mostly vertical movement for the following 5 seconds, and slowly move horizontally to the left for the last 5 seconds.

    * If you're Melee or Throwing, use Scourge of the Cosmos to pile up the eaters during this phase. Then switch to your main weapon after this phase ends. This will speeds up the next phase considerably.	

        * This tactic also works with other classes, though a bit less effective. If you're Mage, use Voltaic Climax to create a couple rings of orbs at the places the brimhearts will spawn in advance during the last few seconds of this phase.

		Second Bullet Hell Phase

    * Stay at the top right corner of the arena. The gigablasts![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_83.png)will spawn from either the top or from the right side of the screen. 

Try to not stay too close to the walls, as you might get stuck in between all the brimstone blasts.

		Third Bullet Hell Phase

    * Stay in the upper half of the arena, both the gigablasts![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_84.png)and abyssal fireblasts![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_85.png)spawn from only the top of the screen. Watch out for the abyssal souls rings![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_86.gif)that may overlap each other.

Brothers Phase

    * The brothers are not very dangerous, as their only attack is to fire a single brimstone blast down at you. Though do be careful as they can snipe you if you're moving diagonally upward.
Dodge by moving mostly vertically.

		

Fourth Bullet Hell Phase

    * Try to begin this phase at the upper half of the arena. This phase is basically the same as the 3rd bullet hell, but when you see a brimstone monster![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_87.png)spawn from the top of the screen slowly move downward. As you progress in the fight more and more of them will appear, but you can stack them on top of each other effectively mitigating the extra numbers completely.

**Note:** From this phase onward you should circle around the arena for the rest of the fight. Try to not turn around and circle the other way unless you get blocked by a brimstone monster or SCal and her projectiles.
It's recommended to try to keep circling in a clockwise direction, as it will make the final bullet hell phase a bit easier to manage.

Soul Seeker Phase
	

    * In this phase nothing changes, but you'll be using different weapons (except Throwing) to clear out the Soul Seeker ring.
Do watch out for the abyssal souls![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_88.gif)that the Soul Seekers fire, as they can snipe you from unexpected and awkward angles.

		Final Bullet Hell Phase

    * In this phase you will be circling the arena in a preferably clockwise motion. 

A counter-clockwise circle will still work, but it'll be a bit harder to manage. This is because moving up in this bullet hell is very dangerous, and the Brimstone Flame Skulls![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_89.gif)will always spawn from the right side of the screen.
Moving counter-clockwise means you’ll be flying up at the right side, which means you’ll be both at risk of getting sniped by projectiles from above, and you’ll be dangerously close to the Brimstone Flame Skulls![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_90.gif)spawn point.![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_91.png)

### Second Sepulcher Phase

    * For this phase you'll be still be circling like normal, you will however need to go slower in order to attack the Brimstone Hearts, it’s risky but necessary to progress the fight

        * Summoners don't have to focus on attacking the hearts at all since the minions will do so for them.

    * If you're unlucky, Sepulcher can spawn in particularly bad spots, possibly getting cheap shots on you with its abyssal souls![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_92.gif). Sadly, nothing much can be done about it other than try your best to dodge it as well as everything else SCal is throwing at you.

### Dying Phase

    * During this phase, SCal will be monologuing while staying in place, not attacking. The only threats in this phase are the brimstone monsters![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_93.png)(which gain a speed boost during this phase), and any leftover projectiles prior to this phase. However, none of the threats here are actually dangerous at all (aside from brimstone monsters, but if you have stacked them they're completely harmless since you can go in a circle).
Simply circle around the arena while waiting for SCal to finish her monologue. When she finishes, she’ll be vulnerable again. Attack her until her HP reaches zero.
