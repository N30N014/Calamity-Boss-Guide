Any Ammo, but preferably the one that has highest damage.    * **Melee**: Bladecrest Oathsword, Ball o' Fugu.    * **Mage**: *Black Anurian*, Demon Scythe.    * **Summoner**: Herring Staff.    * **Throwing**: *Lionfish*, Beenades, Rot/Tooth Ball, Molotov Cocktails (for slimes).* **Weapon explanations:**    * **Any class**: Abyss weapons.

Focus on Crimulan God since his buffs are much more mediocre than Ebonian or Core's. After Crimulan is dead prioritize getting both Ebonian and Core to the lowest health possible and then pop both of them. Reason to this order is that Ebonian constantly spawns flying slimes after being damaged, which can reach you on lower platforms, and you certainly don’t want to divert any attention to them. Killing the Core first might be tempting, but by doing so you’re just going to launch remaining gods into pre-nerf state where they act like biome mimics.![image alt text](../public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_23.png)   * **Strategy 2 - Luigi%**: build this, get into honey, hook yourself to the floor so you don't get warped off the ground, kill the boss (you might fail since this is an old and unstable strat).   ![image alt text](../public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_24.png)
