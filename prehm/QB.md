* **Strategies:**

    * **Strategy 1 - I like cramped spaces**: dig out most of the hive, place platforms. There's nothing really special about this boss, other than it sometimes being laggy as hell, you just jump over/hook under her dashes; slowly walk to the side as she does her machinegun attack; use piercing weapons whenever she summons bees.

    * **Strategy 2 - I don't like cramped spaces and I don’t want to be in the jungle anymore**: the entirety of the above, except the only difference is you tossing a sticky bomb under blocks that have larva sitting on them, warping out to home, proceeding with the fight as usual, but in your normal arena.

    * **Strategy 3 - Big brain**: all you do is keep running to the side, occasionally jumping up if she's dashing at you. The only thing you’ll need is a sizeable platform to which you can lure her.
