* **Strategies:**

    * Dash diagonally towards fishron when he charges you (your movement direction would be perpendicular to his dashing trajectory). He does dashes in bursts of 5 in phase 1, bursts of 3 in phase 2, and bursts of 1, then 2, then 3 in phase 3. The dashes reset to 1 dash after the burst of 3 in the third phase.

    * In the first phase, just run, dash and attack fishron and keep your distance, keep doing this until he gets to his second form when his eyes glow, his speed and damage increase a lot but his defense gets reduced.DO NOT run to the place that you just ran from because there would be a lot of sharknados and tornadoes. In the third form when the background turns blue he will teleport behind you and dash at you. So keep an eye at the map because he can be seen there. the moment before he dashes at you just quickly dash away from him. Keep doing this until you defeat him.
