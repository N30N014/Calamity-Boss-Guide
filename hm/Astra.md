* **Strategies:**

    * Stay **away** from him, move up and down. Do not put a wall between you and him, he completely ignores those with his shots and can warp like KS. Circles can work too, but move slowly if you're doing them. Best strat is just running away while constantly keeping him on screen because now he can teleport. Laser barrages were replaced with shotgun blasts which shouldn’t pose any threat if you’re not standing still.
