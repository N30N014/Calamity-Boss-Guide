    * Have one or two very long bridges. Whenever a worm gets close to you jump up as high as you can with MOAB and either dash/RoD away when the worms try to jump up to meet you. Be careful when doubling back on yourself, there will probably be a lot of orbs left behind where you had been running. Beware of the main worm getting faster as you deal damage to him.
