* **Strategy:**

    * Under no circumstances come close to this really angry slime, because his damage has been buffed to ~6500 per hit (thus rendering any form of defense other than dodging obsolete). Strats generally stay the same from first encounter, but you're not allowed to take even a single hit. Keep your RoD at ready (this also includes your finger on your movement buttons) since he always teleports on top of you and you **don’t** want to be under him when he does it.
