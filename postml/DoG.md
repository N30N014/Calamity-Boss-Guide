    * **Throwing**: Statis' Ninja Belt, Eldritch Soul Artifact.

* **Weapon explanations (if required):**

    * **Ranger: Claret Cannon requires Bloodflare armor, Aether's Whisper is best used with a lower platform made out of solid blocks (since it acts like a Plasma Rod).

    * **Melee**: Collider requires melee speed overclocking and is extremely risky, Solar Flare is subpar to other weapons, if using Banshee Hook aim ahead of DoG to maximize dps. Lacerator is good if you're somehow still playing in 1.1.7.

* **Strategies:**

    * Make two skybridges. During his flying phase, either run along the ground while shooting his head or do a loop above him to get a better line of fire on his face. During his grounded phase, drop him down to an area below your main platform and shoot at him from above. On Rev+, prioritize the Thots when they spawn. Phases can be differentiated either by background color, or by debuffs you get (Warped for passive phase, Extreme Gravity for active). When this phase dies, the sentinels will spawn one at a time. The order is Ceaseless Void, Storm Weaver, and then Signus. When Signus dies, phase 2 starts.
    
    ## Devourer of Gods: Final Form

*"It's not over yet, kid!"*

* **Gear stays the same, but the fight is filled with a new array of deadly attacks.**

* **Strategies:**

* Flying mode stays the same as in phase 1, but ground mode has a completely different AI. When Doggo first drops down, he will try to cut you off, getting in front of you so you have to turn around. Once he drops, he will start charging at you. Early in the fight his charges are rather simple to avoid, but as his health gets lower and he gets faster, he has a much easier time getting to wherever you are. He still has laser walls like in the old update, but they are now only in his "laser wall spam" phases instead of persisting throughout the whole fight. Near the end of the fight, He pretty much constantly shoots his flamethrower, and with him charging you frequently this could be very dangerous.

* During ground phase, drop below your platforms a little bit to get him to fly down below you. He thinks you're dropping down so he tries to drop down with you, but if you fly back up after he starts dropping you’ll get some distance on him.

* Laser wall spam phases are exactly the same, just jump and dash between them. Accessories that increase jump height can make this more complicated.

* When his ground phase gets faster as the fight goes on, do everything you can to get distance on him. Use the dropping below platforms thing, fly up and down between platform layers, etc.
